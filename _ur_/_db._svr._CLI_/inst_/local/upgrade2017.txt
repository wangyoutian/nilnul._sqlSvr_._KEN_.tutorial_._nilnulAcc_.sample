SQL LocalDB: Upgrade to 2017 (14.0.1000)
3 Replies
For me it was quite confusing to find the 2017 version of LocalDB and it is not a streamline process to upgrade your local default instance. The link for ¡°SQL Server 2017 Express LocalDB¡± on official website (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-express) leads to ¡°SQLServer2016-SSEI-Expr.exe¡± which runs a SQL Server 2016 with SP2 installer. Now what?

The easiest way to upgrade your LocalDB instance to 2017 is:

Download the LocalDB 2017 installer directly:
https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/F/2/EF23C21D-7860-4F05-88CE-39AA114B014B/SqlLocalDB.msi

Before running the installer, delete your current MSSQLLocalDB instance:
sqllocaldb stop MSSQLLocalDB
sqllocaldb delete MSSQLLocalDB

Run the LocalDB 2017 installer. It will create a new MSSQLLocalDB instance.

[OPTIONAL] If you did not delete the older instance before running the installer, you can delete it now and recreate the instance. It will be created as new version:
sqllocaldb stop MSSQLLocalDB
sqllocaldb delete MSSQLLocalDB
sqllocaldb create MSSQLLocalDB

Now you can re-attach your original databases using SQL Server Management Studio (RClick + Attach¡­)

Done.
